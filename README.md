## Brief Wiki Description

Competitive landscape is a business analysis method that identifies direct or indirect competitors to help comprehend their mission, vision, core values, niche market, strengths, and weaknesses. Based on the volatile nature of the business world, where companies represent a competition to others, this analysis helps to establish a new mind-set which facilitates the creation of strategic competitiveness.


## Overview

The process envolved all of the above areas:

1. Scrapping - From the https://www.switchup.org/
2. Data Cleaning - We didn't want to use all the data that came from the scappring, and also it had some problems that we needed to fix.
3. Data Engineering - For this project we stored the data in a AWS cloud server.
4. Data Analysis - The final step was to analyse the data that we scrapped to come up with insights.

## How to run the code

The code can be runned, but unfortunately the results would not be the same, because the switchup.org webiste gets constantly updated.
But nevertheless, you can do it like this:

1. Either fork or download this repo.
2. Install all requirements
3. Open the " final_version_1-2.ipynb "
4. Run the code.

## Scrapping

The data was scrapped from the https://www.switchup.org/.

It consist of data from Bootcamps reviews.

## Data Cleaning

## Data Engineering

We also did some feature engineering to get the data that we were interested:

For this project we stored the data in a AWS cloud server:

## Data Analysis

And this were the final tables that we builded:

### The schools table:

The final step was to analyse the data that we scrapped to come up with insights. The presentation is in the " Project2- Competitive landscaping.pptx " file.
