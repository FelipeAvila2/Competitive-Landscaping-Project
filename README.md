4. Data Analysis

## Scrapping

The data was scrapped from the https://www.switchup.org/.

It consist of data from Bootcamps reviews.

## Data Cleaning

We didn't want to use all the data that came from the scappring, and also it had some problems that we needed to fix.

## Data Engineering

For this project we stored the data in a AWS cloud server.

## Data Analysis

The final step was to analyse the data that we scrapped to come up with insights.
